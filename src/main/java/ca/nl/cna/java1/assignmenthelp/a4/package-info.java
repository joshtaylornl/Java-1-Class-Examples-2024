/**
 * Fibonacci Numbers
 * the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number
 * is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is:
 * And
 * The beginning of the sequence is thus: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
 *
 * 1)	Write a class call FibonacciCalculator that does the following:
 * a.	Has a method called isFibonacciNumber that determines whether an integer is in the Fibonacci sequence
 * b.	Has a method called getFibonacciNumber that returns the nth Fibonacci number. (Note it takes in n as a parameter and calculates the number)
 * 2)	Create an application that application that does the following:
 * a.	Determines and displays all the Fibonacci numbers less than a value input by the user (ie. print all Fibonacci numbers up to 1,000)
 * b.	Prints n Fibonacci numbers (ie. Print the first 25 Fibonacci numbers)
 * c.	Checks to see if a number input by the user is a Fibonacci number (ie. Is 23 a Fibonacci number?
 * d.	Has a nice console interface to manage these options.
